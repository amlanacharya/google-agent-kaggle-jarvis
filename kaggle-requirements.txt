# JARVIS Kaggle POC - Minimal Requirements
# ==========================================
#
# This is a lightweight requirements file for running JARVIS in Kaggle notebooks.
# Only essential packages are included to minimize installation time and dependencies.

# Core AI/ML
google-generativeai>=0.3.0    # Gemini API client
numpy>=1.24.0                  # Numerical operations for embeddings

# Optional: Web capabilities (for enhanced research)
requests>=2.31.0               # HTTP requests for web search

# Optional: Better async support
asyncio>=3.4.3                 # Async operations (usually built-in)

# Note: The POC is designed to work with minimal dependencies
# Additional packages from the full version that are NOT required:
# - chromadb (we use in-memory vector store instead)
# - redis (no external state management)
# - fastapi (POC is notebook-based, not API)
# - langchain/langgraph (simplified orchestration)
# - speech_recognition/gtts (no voice capabilities in POC)
# - opencv-python (no video processing in POC)
