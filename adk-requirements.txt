# JARVIS Google ADK Version - Requirements
# ==========================================
#
# This requirements file is for the Google ADK-based implementation of JARVIS.
# It includes the official Google Agent Development Kit.

# Google ADK (Agent Development Kit)
google-adk>=0.1.0              # Official Google agent framework

# Google Generative AI (Gemini)
google-generativeai>=0.3.0     # Gemini API client

# Core dependencies
numpy>=1.24.0                  # Numerical operations

# Notebook support (highly recommended for Kaggle/Jupyter)
nest-asyncio>=1.5.0            # Allows nested async event loops in notebooks

# Note: google-adk includes many dependencies automatically:
# - google-genai (types, API clients)
# - asyncio support
# - session management
# - tool infrastructure

# Optional: Enhanced capabilities
requests>=2.31.0               # HTTP requests (if needed beyond google_search)

# Comparison with Custom POC:
# ---------------------------
# Custom POC requirements:
#   - google-generativeai (API)
#   - numpy (vectors)
#   - requests (optional)
#   Total: ~50MB
#
# ADK requirements:
#   - google-adk (framework + all deps)
#   - google-generativeai (included)
#   - numpy
#   Total: ~200MB (includes framework infrastructure)
#
# Trade-off: More dependencies but official support and patterns
